I wrote this C# solution after reading this post on StackOverflow:

If you are too lazy to click on that link, here is the problem statement:

"Given that Pi can be estimated using the function 4 * (1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ...) with more terms giving greater accuracy, write a function that calculates Pi to an accuracy of 5 decimal places."

I wanted to test myself to see if I could implement that function in code.
